## The Data Talent Race: Insights to Attract & Retain Top Professionals

The rapid expansion of the tech industry has intensified competition for top data professionals, making it more challenging for companies to attract and retain the right talent. Roles such as Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and AI Specialists are pivotal in driving innovation and fueling data-driven decision-making. Yet, evolving skill demands, shifting work preferences, and rising compensation expectations add complexity to hiring strategies.

This report analyzes global salary data to uncover key compensation trends based on job roles, experience levels, work models, and company sizes. Armed with these insights, businesses can refine their hiring strategies, optimize salary structures, and position themselves as leading employers in the competitive data job market.

## Model Performance

Using curretn data only best model achieve score 0.30 and MSE 0.15 which is low. Due to the lack of continuous numerical features, the dataset primarily consists of discrete values after converting categorical variables into numerical form. This limitation affects the model's ability to capture underlying patterns, leading to a low performance score.

We can enhance our model using below techniques 

- Feature Engineering

    Creating new feature `vacancy_param` combine job details

    `vacancy_param` = `experience_level` + `employment_type` + `company_size`

- Target Encoding

    Replacing categorical values with the mean of the target variable for each category, this is useful when a categorical feature has many unique values

    We will use this encoding with job_title and company_location instead of lebel encoding

  The model's performance improved from **R¬≤ = 0.30 to 0.38** due to target encoding and feature engineering, These optimizations enhanced the model's ability to capture complex relationships, resulting in a **7%** increase in R¬≤ score.
